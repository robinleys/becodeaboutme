    <h2>You can always count on me when...</h2>
        One positive contribution I will make to our group is leveraging my strong organizational skills to ensure that we stay on track and meet our goals efficiently. I will coordinate schedules, set up meetings, and maintain clear communication channels. Additionally, I'll focus on fostering a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns. By doing so, I hope to help us work cohesively and maximize our collective potential.

    <h2>A funny story</h2>

    One summer, my family decided to go camping in the mountains. My younger brother, who had just discovered his love for fishing, was determined to catch a big fish. Early one morning, he grabbed his fishing pole and headed down to the lake. After a few hours, we heard him screaming for help. We rushed to the lake, only to find him struggling to reel in what he claimed was a "monster fish." It turned out he had snagged his own backpack that had fallen into the water earlier. He was so determined and focused, convinced he had a big catch, that we couldn't help but burst into laughter. He didn't catch any fish that day, but he did become the hero of our family camping trip with his epic backpack catch.

    <h3>TL;DR</h3>

    My brother, convinced he caught a big fish while camping, hilariously reeled in his own backpack instead.
